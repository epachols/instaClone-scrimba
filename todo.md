# next steps

- [ ] add onhover with the comments length & add the likes

- [ ] add a lightbox where you can add comments - karl hadwen's lightbox tutorial on youtube

- [ ]     think about caching in profile index file in localstorage so we don't make a network call we have already made previously

- [ ] view all comments in a popup (maybe put this in parent component) - look at React portals to make this happen

- [ ] https://apidocs.imgur.com/ -> consider the imgur api (free for open source)
